# Introduction

Helene is an event-driven **real-time framework** for **Node.js** and **React**.

Great for fast prototypes, small projects, and large applications.

It's **easy to use** and **easy to scale**. If you have more than a single server instance, you can use Redis to allow communication between them.

Instead of setting up and calling REST endpoints or GraphQL schemas, you can call methods declared in a simple syntax.
You still can do that if you want to as Helene exposes the underlying Express instance.

Helene methods work via WebSockets and automatically revert to HTTP in its absence.

It supports authentication, channels, data manipulation and persistence, middlewares, React hooks and more.

Send events to a specific user, a group of users, or all users.

Authorize events to specific users or groups.

The client is isomorphic and can be used in the browser or in Node.js, with or without React.

## Installation

```shell
npm install helene
```

```shell
yarn add helene
```

## Example



<ConnectedNodes/>

If you open a new tab you will notice this updates in real-time. This can be done as easily as:

```jsx
// connected-nodes.jsx

import { useMethod } from 'helene/react'

export function ConnectedNodes() {
  const { result: connections } = useMethod({
    method: 'connection.count',
    defaultValue: 0,
  })

  return (
    <div className='stats bg-base-200 shadow-lg'>
      <div className='stat'>
        <div className='stat-title'>Nodes Connected</div>
        <div className='stat-value'>
          {connections.toLocaleString()}
        </div>
        <div className='stat-desc'>Number of clients connected right now</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

```jsx
// server.js

import { Server, ServerEvents } from 'helene'

new Server({
  port: 3000,
  host: 'localhost',
})

// A simple method that returns the number of connected clients
// This will only work if you have a single server instance
// You could setup Redis and use a shared counter or something similar

Helene.addMethod('connection.count', function () {
  return this.server.allClients.size
})

// Refresh the method every time a client connects or disconnects
// Just a trivial example, you could use a channel and events for fine-grained control
// The `refresh` method is scoped to the main channel by default, it will update the method for all clients in it

Helene.on(ServerEvents.CONNECTION, () => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    Helene.refresh('connection.count')
  }, 1000) // Account for latency
})

Helene.on(ServerEvents.DISCONNECTION, () => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    Helene.refresh('connection.count')
  }, 1000)
})
```

This is just a simple example, you can do much more with Helene.
