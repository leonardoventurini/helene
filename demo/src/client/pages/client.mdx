## Client

The client allows interaction with the server, it works either in the browser or in other node instances.

The client can be created like so:

```js
const client = new Client({
  host: 'localhost',
  port: 80
})
```

It is not added to the global scope as you can have multiple clients.

Other ways to use client:

```js
// Connect to the server
client.connect();

// Handle incoming events from the server
client.on('event', data => {
  console.log('Received event:', data);
});

// Call a remote method on the server
client.call('hello').then(result => {
  console.log('Method result:', result);
});
```
