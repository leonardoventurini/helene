### useLocalEvent Hook

The useLocalEvent hook is used to subscribe to local events within your application. 
These events are not communicated to the server but instead are triggered and handled locally within the client-side React components.

```jsx
useLocalEvent(
  { event, channel },
  value => console.log(value),
  [],
)
```

### useRemoteEvent Hook

This hook will automatically subscribe to the event on the server.

```jsx
useRemoteEvent(
  { event, channel },
  value => console.log(value),
  [],
)
```
