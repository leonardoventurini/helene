### useMethod Hook

This hook can be used to load data from the server and refresh it when needed. 

In the future we will add support for Live Queries and other more precise techniques.

```jsx
const { result, loading, refresh } = useMethod({
  method: 'hello',
})

// Refresh the method in the client programmatically
refresh()

// Refresh the method in the server programmatically

Helene.refresh('hello')
```
