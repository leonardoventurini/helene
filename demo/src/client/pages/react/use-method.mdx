### useMethod Hook

The useMethod hook is a powerful tool that facilitates loading data from the server 
and provides an easy way to refresh that data when necessary.

In the future we will add support for Live Queries and other more precise techniques.

```jsx
const { result, loading, refresh } = useMethod({
  method: 'hello',
})

// Refresh the method in the client programmatically
refresh()

// Refresh the method in the server programmatically

Helene.refresh('hello')
```
