## Events

Events allow you to invert the control of the application by casting a piece of data to a set of clients.

You can group these clients in different ways by using channels.

Events need to be declared first:

```js
server.addEvent('event', { protected: false })
```

Then you can subscribe to it from the client:

```js
client.subscribe('event')
```

You can now listen to that event in the client app:

```js
client.on('event', console.log)
```

We can emit something from the server:

```js
server.emit('event', 42)
```
