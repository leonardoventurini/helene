## Channels

In Helene, Channels are a powerful feature that allows you to segment clients into specific groups based on certain criteria. Channels enable more targeted and efficient communication by allowing events to be emitted to specific groups of clients rather than broadcasting to all connected clients.


In the server just use:

```js
server.channel('chat:1')
```

or chain it like so:

```js
server.channel('chat:1').addEvent('message')
```

To emit data to a specific channel on the server, you can use the emit method with the appropriate channel name:

```js
server.channel('chat:1').emit('message', { 
  author: 'John Doe', 
  content: 'Hello World'
})
```

On the client side, you can subscribe to a channel using the subscribe method:

```js
await client.channel('chat:1').subscribe('message')
```
nce subscribed, the client will start receiving updates from the events associated with this channel.

By using Channels, you can optimize real-time communication and improve the performance and scalability of your application by reducing unnecessary data broadcasting to clients that are not interested in certain events.
