## Server

You can create a new server instance like so:

```js
new Server({
  host: 'localhost',
  port: 80,
  redis: {
    // We use redis to propagate events to all containers in a cluster
    // This is the default value, you can omit this option and simply pass `true`
    url: 'redis://localhost:6379',
  },
})
```

The server will be globally available in Node as `Helene` so you can do something like this easily:

```js
Helene.addMethod(
  'hello',
  () => 'world')
```
Once you've added the method, clients can use the useMethod hook from the React client-side application to 
invoke this method and fetch the result.

By combining the server setup and method registration with the client-side utilities and hooks like 
useMethod, you can create powerful and interactive applications that communicate seamlessly with the server.
